GPUProc/{src,test} contain several scripts to start observations. The call chain is as follows:

      OnlineControl (MAC)
       |         ^
       V         |
startBGL.sh -> runObservation.sh -> mpirun.sh -> [mpirun] rtcp
    ^                ^
    |                |
tstartBGL.sh    tMACfeedback.sh
                tProductionParsets.sh
                testParset.sh

The central thread is the main call chain, with the following roles and responsibilities:

  startBGL.sh:        - starts an observation in the background
                      - adheres to specific parameter order as specified by OnlineControl
                      - augments parset with Cobalt-specific settingsa

  runObservation.sh:  - (optionally) copies feedback to MAC after the observation
                      - (optionally) informs OnlineControl after observation finishes

  mpirun.sh:          - acts as mpirun, but wraps the currently selected MPI library
                        (OpenMPI, MVAPICH2, no MPI) in a generic way.

  rtcp:               - the actual program that performs the observation
