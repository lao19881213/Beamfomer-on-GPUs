The InputProc package manages the data flow from the packets that are received
from the antenna fields, to the input buffers of GPUProc.

The data flow between systems is as follows:

[Station] --UDP--> [IONode] --MPI--> [GPUNode]

The extended data flow between classes is as follows:

[Station/Generator]               Generator: a class that emulates RSP boards
   |
  UDP [Station/RSP]               RSP: describes the packet format
   |
   V
[Station/PacketReader]            PacketReader: reads RSP packets from any Stream
   |
  L1 cache [Station/RSP]
   |
   V
[Station/PacketWriter]            PacketWriter: writes RSP packets into a
   |                                            circular buffer
  SHM [Buffer/SampleBuffer]       SampleBuffer: manages a circular buffer
   |                                            in shared memory (SHM)
   V
[Buffer/BlockReader]              BlockReader: generates copy information to
   |                                           read blocks from the circular
  (pointers)                                   buffer
   |
   V
[Transpose/MPISendStation]        MPISendStation: distributes subbands from
   |                                              a single station
  MPI
   |
   V
[Transpose/MPIReceiveStations]    MPIReceiveStations: collects subbands from
                                                      multiple stations
